# Sector Control Respawn Management Script

## Overview

**Script Name:** `fn_respawnsectorControl_independentWest_1.sqf`  
**Author:** BrianV1981  
**Description:**  
This script dynamically manages respawn points based on sector control in Arma 3. It automatically enables and disables respawn points for specific factions depending on which side controls the sector. The script is particularly useful in scenarios where Independent (GUER) and West (BLUFOR) factions share control, granting respawn points to both when either is in control, while East (OPFOR) receives a respawn point only when it captures the sector.

## Features

- **Dynamic Respawn Creation:** Automatically creates a respawn point at predefined markers when a faction captures the sector.
- **Joint Respawn Logic:** If Independent or West controls the sector, both factions receive a respawn point. If CSAT (East) controls the sector, only CSAT gets a respawn point.
- **Mission Status Notifications:** Displays a custom message when a sector is secured, showing the capturing faction's name, the sector's map grid, and the time of capture.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Works with predefined markers named `respawnWest_sector_1`, `respawnIndependent_sector_1`, and `respawnEast_sector_1`.

## How to Use

1. **Place Markers in the Editor:**
   - Place markers on the map where you want respawn points to appear. Name them:
     - `respawnWest_sector_1`
     - `respawnIndependent_sector_1`
     - `respawnEast_sector_1`

2. **Save the Script:**
   - Save the `fn_respawnsectorControl_independentWest_1.sqf` script in your mission's `scripts/sector_control/` folder.

3. **Configure the Sector Control Module:**
   - In the Arma 3 editor, place a `ModuleSector_F`.
   - In the Expression field (found under System Specific - Sector category), enter the following line:
     ```sqf
     [_this select 0, _this select 1, _this select 2] execVM 'scripts\sector_control\fn_respawnsectorControl_independentWest_1.sqf';
     ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Start your mission and observe how the respawn points are created or disabled based on sector control changes. Ensure that the respawn logic works correctly for each faction as they gain or lose control of the sector.

## Important Notes

- **Marker Names:** Ensure that the markers in the editor match the names used in the script (`respawnWest_sector_1`, `respawnIndependent_sector_1`, `respawnEast_sector_1`).
- **Respawn ID Management:** The script dynamically stores the respawn ID when a point is created and removes it when no longer needed, ensuring clean management of respawn points with missions that utilize multiple sector respawn points/sectors.
- **Script Execution:** This script is triggered whenever the sector changes control, ensuring that only the controlling faction has access to the respawn point.

## Tactical Insight

This script provides an effective solution for managing respawn points in dynamic sector control scenarios. By automatically adjusting respawn points based on sector control, it enhances the realism and strategic depth of your Arma 3 missions. This setup is particularly beneficial in missions where joint faction control (e.g., Independent and West) is a key gameplay element, as it ensures that both factions have equal access to respawn points when they share control of a sector.
